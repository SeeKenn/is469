# FinSight: RAG-based Financial Filings QA System
## 1. Problem Motivations & Objectives
### Problem Statement
Financial filings (e.g., SEC 10-K and 10-Q reports) are lengthy, complex, and difficult for users to navigate efficiently. Extracting specific financial insights—such as revenue trends, segment performance, or risk disclosures—requires significant manual effort and domain knowledge.

### Objective
To develop FinSight, a domain-specific question-answering (QA) system over Microsoft SEC filings using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. The system aims to:
- Provide accurate, citation-backed answers to financial questions
- Compare multiple RAG architectures to evaluate performance trade-offs
- Analyse when advanced retrieval strategies improve answer quality

## 2. Project Scope
This project implements & evaluates 3 RAG variants
| Variant | Pipeline | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **V1 Baseline** | Dense → Generate | Fixed-size chunking + embedding retrieval |
| **V2 Advanced A** | Dense → Rerank → Generate | Dense retrieval + cross-encoder reranking |
| **V3 Advanced B** | BM25 + Dense → RRF → Rerank → Generate | Hybrid retrieval + RRF fusion + reranking |

The project addresses a real-world financial QA task, aligning with domain-specific RAG system requirements.

### Data Flow
1. Ingestion: Parse SEC filing PDFs into structured texts
2. Chunking: Split documents into fixed-sized segments with metadata
3. Indexing:
    * Dense embeddings -> vector store (ChromaDB)
    * Sparse Indexing -> BM25
4. Retrieval: Dense / Sparse / Hybrid retrieval
5. Generation: LLM produces answers using retrieved content
6. Output: Answers with source citations

**Note:** Microsoft fiscal year ends June 30. Q1=Jul–Sep, Q2=Oct–Dec, Q3=Jan–Mar, Q4=Apr–Jun.

Characteristics:
* Long-form financial documents
* Structured but noisy text (tables, footnotes)
* Requires numerical reasoning, and cross-section referencing

## **5. Methodology (Detailed Design & Rationale)**

### **5.1 Document Processing & Chunking Strategy**
The ingestion pipeline converts SEC filing PDFs into structured text using a parsing module that removes boilerplate artifacts (headers, footers, page numbers) and preserves section-level structure where possible.

**Chunking Approach (Current):**
* Fixed-size chunking (e.g., 500–800 tokens with overlap)
* Overlap (~10–20%) to preserve context continuity
* Metadata tagging:
  * Document type (10-K / 10-Q)
  * Fiscal year / quarter
  * Section (if identifiable, e.g., “Risk Factors”, “MD&A”)

**Rationale:**
* Fixed-size chunking ensures consistent embedding quality and retrieval efficiency
* Overlap reduces boundary fragmentation (important for financial narratives)

**Known Trade-offs:**
* May split tables or financial statements incorrectly
* May reduce coherence for multi-paragraph reasoning

**Planned Improvement:**
* Compare against **semantic chunking** (section-based splitting)
* Evaluate impact on retrieval precision and answer faithfulness

---

### **5.2 Retrieval Strategies**

#### **a. Dense Retrieval (V1, V2)**
* Uses embedding model to encode query and document chunks
* Retrieves top-k semantically similar chunks via vector similarity

**Strengths:**
* Captures semantic meaning (e.g., “cloud revenue” ≈ “Azure growth”)

**Weaknesses:**
* May miss exact keyword matches (e.g., specific financial terms or figures)

---

#### **b. Sparse Retrieval (BM25)**
* Lexical matching based on term frequency and inverse document frequency

**Strengths:**
* Strong for keyword-heavy queries (e.g., “FY2024 revenue”)

**Weaknesses:**
* Cannot capture semantic relationships

---

#### **c. Hybrid Retrieval with RRF (V3)**

* Combines Dense + BM25 results
* Uses **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** to merge rankings

**RRF Formula:**

* Score = Σ (1 / (k + rank_i))

**Rationale:**

* Improves recall by combining semantic + lexical signals
* Reduces risk of missing relevant chunks

**Expected Behavior:**

* Better performance on:
  * Multi-hop queries
  * Ambiguous queries

* Potential downside:
  * Introduces noise → requires reranking

---

### **5.3 Reranking Module (V2, V3)**

* Cross-encoder model evaluates query–chunk pairs
* Produces relevance scores for final ranking

**Purpose:**

* Improve **precision at top-k**
* Filter noisy results from hybrid retrieval

**Trade-offs:**

* Increased latency
* Additional compute cost

**Hypothesis:**

* Reranking significantly improves answer faithfulness by ensuring only highly relevant context is passed to the generator

---

### **5.4 Generation Module**

* LLM generates answers conditioned on retrieved context
* Prompt includes:

  * Retrieved chunks
  * Instructions for grounded answering
  * Citation formatting requirements

**Key Design Choices:**

* Low temperature → reduce hallucination
* Structured prompts → enforce answer format

**Output Requirements:**

* Direct answer
* Supporting citations (document + section)

---

### **5.5 Guardrails & Safety Mechanisms**

**Implemented Controls:**

* Out-of-scope detection (reject unrelated queries)
* Mandatory citation enforcement
* Context-limited answering (no external knowledge)

**Rationale:**

* Financial QA requires high factual reliability
* Prevent hallucinated financial figures

---

## **6. Evaluation Plan (Comprehensive Framework)**

### **6.1 Quantitative Evaluation**

Evaluation will be conducted using **RAGAS metrics**, including:

* **Faithfulness**: Alignment with retrieved context
* **Answer Relevance**: Relevance to the question
* **Context Precision**: Quality of retrieved chunks
* **Context Recall**: Coverage of relevant information

**Experimental Setup:**

* 20 benchmark questions
* Same dataset across all variants
* Controlled parameters (top-k, temperature)

---

### **6.2 Qualitative Evaluation (Critical Component)**

A structured **error analysis framework** with case categories will be applied:

1. **Retrieval Failure:** Relevant chunk not retrieved
2. **Ranking Failure:** Relevant chunk retrieved but ranked too low
3. **Chunking Failure:** Information split across chunks
4. **Generation Failure:** LLM misinterprets context or hallucinates

---

#### **Analysis Method**

For each failure:
* Compare expected vs generated answer
* Inspect retrieved chunks
* Identify root cause
* Propose fix

---

### **6.3 Category-Based Evaluation**

Questions will be grouped into:

* **Factual Retrieval** (e.g., revenue figures)
* **Temporal Reasoning** (e.g., quarter-over-quarter growth)
* **Multi-hop Reasoning** (cross-section synthesis)
* **Comparative Analysis** (e.g., year-over-year changes)

**Goal:**

* Identify which pipeline performs best per category
* Understand strengths & downsides of each retrieval strategy

---

### **6.4 Ablation Study (Component-Level Analysis)**

To isolate impact of components:

| Experiment         | Description               |

| BM25 only          | Sparse retrieval          |
| Hybrid (no rerank) | Fusion without refinement |
| Hybrid + rerank    | Full pipeline             |

**Metrics Compared:**

* RAGAS scores
* Retrieval precision
* Answer accuracy

---

### **6.5 Latency & Efficiency Analysis**

**Measure:**
* End-to-end response time per query
* Retrieval vs reranking vs generation time

**Purpose:** Evaluate trade-offs between:
  * Accuracy
  * Speed
  * Computational cost

---

## **7. Expected Insights & Hypotheses**

The study aims to validate:

1. **Hybrid retrieval improves recall**
   * Especially for complex or ambiguous queries

2. **Reranking improves precision**
